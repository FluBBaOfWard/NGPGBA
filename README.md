# NGPGBA V0.5.5

<img align="right" width="220" src="./logo.png" />

This is a SNK Neogeo Pocket (Color) emulator for the Nintendo GBA.

## How to use:

There is no builder included in the release yet.
The header is defined in Emubase.h, it's 64 bytes long, the size field is in
little endian, the 32bit id is 0x1A50474E (LE).
The name field can be 31 bytes plus a terminating zero.
There is an example header file included, "ngp.header".

When the emulator starts, you press L+R to open up the menu.
Now you can use the cross to navigate the menus, A to select an option, B to
go back a step.
To get maximum speed turn off sound and set Z80 CPU to 1/16 speed, maybe even
turn on overclock EWRAM.
